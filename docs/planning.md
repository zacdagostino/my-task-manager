# Kanban Task Manager Application - Planning Document

## Project Overview

This document outlines the design and development plan for a Kanban Task Manager web application. The application will allow users to organize tasks into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. It will feature a responsive front-end using Next.js and TypeScript, a robust back-end with a RESTful API, user authentication, and persistent data storage.

## Objective

The primary goal is to develop a web-based Kanban task manager that enables users to:

- Organize tasks across multiple columns representing different stages of a process.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop.
- Authenticate users to maintain personal or shared workspaces.
- Ensure smooth interaction, responsiveness, and security throughout.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- **Front-end:** Responsive web interface using Next.js and TypeScript.
- **Back-end:** A RESTful API for data handling, user management, and authentication.
- **Database:** Persistent data storage for users, tasks, and associated metadata.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system.
- **API Integration:** Interaction between front-end and back-end through secure REST API calls.

**Out of Scope:**

- Mobile app development.
- Advanced project management features like Gantt charts.

## Technologies

**Front-End:**

- **Next.js:** For building server-rendered React applications and managing routing.
- **TypeScript:** For adding static type definitions to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** For styling, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
- **React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd:** For drag-and-drop functionality.

**Back-End:**

- **Node.js with Express:** For server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB (or PostgreSQL):** NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For user authentication and session management.
- **Bcrypt.js:** For password hashing and security.

**Version Control:**

- **Git** for version control, with **GitHub** or **GitLab** for repository management.

**Deployment:**

- **Front-End:** Deploy using Vercel or Netlify.
- **Back-End:** Deploy using Heroku or AWS.

## System Architecture

**High-Level Overview:**

- **Client (Front-End):** The Next.js application (written in TypeScript) interacts with the user, sending requests to the back-end via HTTP.
- **Server (Back-End):** The Node.js server with Express receives requests, performs business logic, interacts with the database, and returns responses to the client.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores the task data, user profiles, and authentication credentials.

## Database Schema

**User Collection:**

| Field      | Type   | Description                |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| _id        | String | Unique identifier (auto-generated) |
| username   | String | User's username (unique)   |
| password   | String | Hashed password            |
| email      | String | User's email address       |
| createdAt  | Date   | Timestamp for user creation|

**Task Collection:**

| Field       | Type   | Description                |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------|
| _id         | String | Unique task identifier     |
| title       | String | Task title                 |
| description | String | Task details or notes      |
| status      | String | Task stage (To Do, In Progress) |
| priority    | String | Priority level (Low, Medium, High) |
| createdAt   | Date   | Creation timestamp         |
| updatedAt   | Date   | Last updated timestamp     |
| assignedTo  | String | User assigned to the task  |

## API Specifications

**Authentication Routes:**

- `POST /api/register`: Registers a new user.
- `POST /api/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.

**Task Routes:**

- `GET /api/tasks`: Fetch all tasks for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update a task.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to register an account so I can save my tasks.
2. As a user, I want to log in so I can access my saved tasks.
3. As a user, I want to add tasks in the "To Do" column.
4. As a user, I want to move tasks between columns via drag-and-drop.
5. As a user, I want to edit tasks to update their details.
6. As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need.

## Wireframes & UI Design

**Wireframes:** Simple hand-drawn sketches or low-fidelity digital mockups will be created in tools like Figma to visualize the layout.

**High-Fidelity Mockups:** Once wireframes are finalized, high-fidelity mockups will be developed showing actual colors, buttons, and interactions.

## Development Phases

**Phase 1: Initial Setup**

- Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript.
- Configure the environment (Node.js, MongoDB).
- Create boilerplate for the front-end and back-end.

**Phase 2: Front-End Development**

- Build static UI components in Next.js.
- Implement the drag-and-drop Kanban interface using TypeScript.

**Phase 3: Back-End Development**

- Set up Node.js with Express.
- Create the API for task management (CRUD operations).
- Set up MongoDB and connect to the back-end.

**Phase 4: Integration**

- Connect front-end (Next.js) with back-end APIs.
- Test end-to-end functionality.

**Phase 5: Testing**

- Perform unit and integration testing.
- Conduct end-to-end testing and performance testing.

**Phase 6: Deployment**

- Deploy front-end application using Vercel or Netlify.
- Deploy back-end application using Heroku or AWS.
- Set up domain and SSL.

## Security

- Implement user authentication with JWT.
- Ensure data validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and APIs.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that components and APIs work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real-world usage to identify any issues.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluate application performance under load.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Front-End:** Deploy using Vercel or Netlify.
- **Back-End:** Deploy using Heroku or AWS.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Domain and SSL:** Purchase a domain and configure SSL for secure access.

## Maintenance and Scalability

- **Monitoring:** Use tools to monitor application performance and errors.
- **Updates:** Regularly update libraries and frameworks.
- **Scalability:** Plan for scaling the application to handle increased traffic and data.
